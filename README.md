Healthy Living from First Principles

"Width of life is more important than length of life." - Avicenna

A life lived without adventure, deep relationships, good health, and excellence, is not a life. It's a prison sentence. <br>
So embark on your adventure, nurture relationships along the way, take care of the body and mind you've been given, and whatever you do, do it well, and with all your heart.
