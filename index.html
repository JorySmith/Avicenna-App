            A life lived without adventure, deep relationships, and excellence
            is not a life. It's a prison sentence. <br />

                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />
                Ask for help. You don't have to do this alone.
                <br />
                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or nurse
                practitioner, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. Find the Truth
                through research, testing, and experimentation, and not by
                blindly trusting what someone says on the internet.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble, don't beat
                yourself up. Get back up. Keep going.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You
                got this. Make it happen.
                <br />
                Right here, right now.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Eating small meals every 3 hours and staying hydrated. Increasing protein, soluble fiber, and omega 3's intake. Taking a 
                    daily multivitamin.
                    Reducing carbohydrate, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium intake.

                      Add walking to your routine for aerobic cardio, or find

                      Add running to your routine for anaerobic cardio, or find
                      alternatives you prefer. Anaerobic cardio significantly
                      boosts metabolic rate and increases lactic threshold

                      Losing even a little weight

              <p>The consequences of unhealthy teeth, gums, and tongue are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Gum disease, oral infections that can spread to other areas of
                  the body, and tooth loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Higher likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease,
                  diabetes, and even Alzheimer's disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bad breath and worse relationships because people tend to
                  perceive you as irresponsible and careless.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                It's best to brush your teeth and tongue twice a day: once before bed, and once in
                the morning. <br />You only need to use toothpaste for one of
                those times. You can just use water (the universal solvent) and
                brushing for the other time. <br />It's best to floss once
                or more a week, or when food gets stuck in your teeth.
                <br />Consider a dental checkup every 6 months, but if that's
                too costly, try to go at least once a year, or every other
                year at worst.
