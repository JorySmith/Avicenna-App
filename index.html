            A life lived without adventure, excellence, and deep relationships,
            is not a life. It's a prison sentence. <br />

                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />
                Ask for help. You don't have to do this alone.
                <br />
                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or physician's
                assistant, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. Find the Truth
                through research, testing, and experimentation, and not by
                blindly trusting what someone says on the internet.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble, don't beat
                yourself up. Get back up. Keep going.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You
                got this. Make it happen.
                <br />
                Right here, right now.

                <li>

                    <li>
                      High levels of LDL cholesterol contribute to plaque

                    <li>
                      High levels of blood sugar damage blood vessels and organs
                      through inflammation, oxidative stress, and increasing

                      Try to avoid or limit eating the hazardous nutrients
                      discussed above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Try increasing protein, soluble fiber, and omega-3 fatty
                      acids (fish oil) intake.

                  <strong>Exercise a Little Each Day</strong>

                    <li>30 minutes a day is all you need.</li>
                    <li>Add strength training to your routine to build muscle strength, improve 
                    bone health, boost metabolism, and manage weight. And look more attractive!</li>
                    <li>Add walking to your routine for aerobic cardio, or find
                    alternatives you prefer. Aerobic cardio strengthens your

                      stress, anxiety, and depression.</li>
                    <li>Add running to your routine for anaerobic cardio, or find
                    alternatives you prefer. Anaerobic cardio 
                      significantly boosts metabolic rate and
                    increases lactic threshold (ability to

                  <ul>
                    <li>Strive for 120/80 or better.</li>
                    <li>
                      Reduce sodium intake and consume sufficient potassium.

                    <li>Exercise.</li>
                    <li>Get plenty of sleep.</li>
                    <li>
                      Manage stress through healthy coping strategies (see
                      Principle 6).

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lose Weight</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Strive for 10% body fat or less for men, 20% or less for
                      women.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Eat foods that help you feel fuller faster, like soluble
                      fiber and protein.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Try to lower caloric intake. Losing even a little weight
                      can dramatically reduce the chances of cardiovascular
                      issues by reducing toxic excess blood sugar,
                      triglycerides, organ fat, and visceral fat as well as
                      lowering blood pressure.
                    </li>

                >Any effort without collaboration will always be and always
                remain incomplete because we are all unique and two minds are
                better than one. So I humbly reach out to you with a call for
                aid. Would you mind providing the final principles so we can
                build this together? Maybe we can go faster alone, but we can go
                much further together. Divided we fall. United we stand.
