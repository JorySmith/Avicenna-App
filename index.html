            A life lived without adventure, deep relationships, good health, and excellence,
            is not a life. It's a prison sentence. <br />
            So embark on your adventure, nurture relationships along the way,
            take care of the body and mind you've been given, 
            and whatever you do, do it well, and with all your heart.

                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />
                Ask for help. You don't have to do this alone.
                <br />
                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or nurse
                practitioner, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. <br />
                Find the Truth through your own research, exploration, and
                experimentation. Asking questions and listening can become some
                of your most powerful problem solving tools. So try copying and
                pasting any statements on this site into an AI chatbot and ask,
                "Is this true?" You'll be well on your way to finding the truth.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble and fail,
                don't beat yourself up. Nobody's perfect. Get back up and keep
                moving forward.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You

              <p>
                First, my mom told me over and over again: "I don't care what
                you do honey, I love you. But whatever you do, do it well." So
                that's what I focused on. And I focused on that primarily on the
                daily timeframe. Today is the championship. How can I crush
                it today? Results followed.

                Second, I moved around a lot as a kid. We moved at least 8 times
                across 3 states by the time I was 16. I was usually the new kid
                everywhere we went. So to fit in as quickly as possible — or at
                least avoid being a total outcast loser — I learned what worked
                best: Be funny. Be helpful.

                The most interesting people are the most interested in other
                people. Worry less about trying to be cool, and focus more on
                asking people cool questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you find yourself in an argument that feels like it's
                barreling toward disaster, consider saying: "You're right, makes
                sense." Now you may think you're not telling the truth, but
                that's not quite right. There's a 99% chance you missed
                something, even if it is only a small, minuscule detail. You
                still missed something.
              </p>
              <p>
                So show some compassion and humility by admitting it, and you
                will have unlocked a world of opportunity that just my save you
                from ruining a relationship. In fact, you may even strengthen
                it.

              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Car Crashes</strong>: Sleep deprivation impairs
                  reaction times and decision-making, contributing to thousands
                  of car accidents annually. Studies estimate that drowsy
                  driving causes up to 20% of fatal crashes in some regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Workplace Accidents</strong>: Fatigue from lack of
                  sleep increases errors and injuries in high-risk jobs like
                  construction, healthcare, and manufacturing, costing billions
                  in damages and lost productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Healthcare Burden</strong>: Chronic sleep deprivation
                  drives up rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease,
                  straining public health systems and increasing medical costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Tension</strong>: Irritability and poor
                  emotional regulation from sleep loss can strain relationships,
                  increase conflict, and reduce community cohesion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <span>Effects on the Immune System</span>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduced Immune Response</strong>: Sleep is critical
                  for producing cytokines, proteins that fight infection and
                  inflammation. Less sleep means fewer cytokines, weakening your
                  defense against viruses and bacteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Slower Wound Healing</strong>: Lack of sleep impairs
                  the body's ability to repair itself, delaying recovery from
                  injuries or infections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increased Inflammation</strong>: Chronic sleep loss
                  triggers higher levels of inflammatory markers (e.g.,
                  C-reactive protein), which can contribute to diseases like
                  arthritis or diabetes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Higher Infection Risk</strong>: With a weakened immune
                  system, you're more susceptible to colds, flu, and other
                  illnesses.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testosterone</strong>: In men, sleep loss lowers
                  testosterone levels, affecting muscle mass, libido, and
                  energy. A single night of bad sleep can drop it by 10-15%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cortisol (Stress Hormone)</strong>: Sleep deprivation
                  spikes cortisol levels, keeping you in a stressed,
                  fight-or-flight state. This can lead to anxiety and burnout.
                </li>
                <li>

                  Alcohol reduces REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the

                </li>
                <li>
                  Alcohol relaxes throat muscles, worsening snoring or

                <li>
                  Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, a chemical that promotes
                  sleepiness, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially
                  delaying sleep by 30-60 minutes or more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even if you fall asleep, caffeine decreases deep sleep

                  Try to avoid jacking up your energy state starting at least

                  Try to create a cooler environment around you before going to

                  maximize sleep quality. Air conditioning can be very helpful
                  here but also extremely expensive. A great alternative is to
                  use a fan. Fans can be just as effective as AC while also

                  AC or even fans may not be working for you. Try drinking a

                  If you can't fall asleep within 15-30 minutes of going to bed,

                </li>
                <li>
                  If so, try to stop and think about your happy place, or
                  nothing at all. The latter is surprisingly effective, but
                  challenging to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If those don't work, have a notepad nearby that you can use to
                  write down your worries and frustrations. Try to capture in
                  words what's really bothering you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overthinking and ruminating are your brain's ways of trying to
                  help you. Your brain wants you to see and fully understand
                  some specific problems, and then solve them to avoid future
                  pain. Show it some respect. Write it all down. Writing proves
                  to your brain that you actually see the problems and threats,
                  which is half the battle. Once you prove this to your brain
                  through writing, it will then allow you to relax and fall
                  asleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But before trying to fall asleep again, schedule a time
                  tomorrow to further tackle your thoughts and worries. The goal
                  is to fully prove to your brain that you see these threats and
                  are committed to tackling them. Tell your brain you need sleep
                  to do so, or these future problems could get much worse.

              <p>
                The adage, "You can't outrun a bad diet," is mostly true.
                However, being sedentary is catastrophic to our health because
                it significantly increases the risk of death from cardiovascular
                disease and cancer. Furthermore, this adage fails to account for
                the benefits exercise has on sticking to a healthier diet.
                Embarking on a healthy diet without exercise can be quite
                challenging. But exercise can make it much easier by improving
                mental health, elevating nutrient absorption, and dampening food
                cravings, especially for unhealthy food.

              </strong>
              <p>
                Every time you exercise, your body goes into action removing
                old, damaged cells to make way for new, healthy ones. <br />
                Intense exercise increases body temperature, metabolic stress,
                and oxidative stress. These stressors trigger the release of
                heat shock proteins, which help protect cells by refolding
                damaged proteins, preventing protein clumping, and aiding
                cellular repair.<br /><br />
                Therefore, Exercise is a whole body and mind rejuvenation.
                <br /><br />
                Without exercise, your body becomes clogged and cluttered with
                unhealthy cells, which significantly increases the risk of

              <p>
                Try to avoid getting injured or you won't be able to maintain
                crucial consistency. Showing up for even a little bit of
                exercise is infinitely better than not.
              </p>
              <p>The leading causes of injury tend to be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Explosive actions. Moving too fast.</li>
                <li>
                  Lifting much heavier weight than your body is used to, or
                  doing much more sets/reps than your body is used to.
                </li>
                <li>Poor technique and form.</li>
                <li>
                  Not warming up the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints
                  before intense effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pushing through pain that feels like a sudden, sharp sting. A
                  burning sensation is generally what you're looking for. Sudden
                  sharp pain is not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your muscles or joints are sore, you probably need more time off 
                  from the gym — or at least lighter weight per rep — to help give 
                  them time to heal and grow stronger.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong class="title-discussion">Strength Training</strong>
              <p>
                Add strength training to your routine to build muscle strength,
                improve bone health, boost metabolism, and manage weight. And
                look more attractive!<br>
                Muscles are huge blood sugar (glucose) sinks, which increases insulin sensitivity and lowers
                the risk of type 2 diabetes and dementia.
                In fact, skeletal muscle is the largest site of glucose disposal in the entire body. <br>
                Aim for at least one 30-minute workout per week, and 6 sets per muscle group (e.g. chest).
              </p>
              <p> Muscles and bones are challenged at the gym through iron and sweat. <br>
                Muscles and bones are built at home through food and sleep. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Your #1 job is to tell your body that this muscle needs to grow.
                <br />
                You do that by putting stress on your muscles, joints, organs,
                and body. As David Goggins put it, "To grow, you must suffer."
                <br />
                One interesting side effect of exercise stress is that some
                cancer cells are too vulnerable to handle it. They die — not all
                of them — but many do because of their vulnerable state. Your
                body rebuilds and replenishes your healthy cells as a response
                to exercise stress, but some cancer cells will die under these
                stressful conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time of day you strength train matters. For me, I'm at least
                20-33% weaker in the early mornings. I'm much stronger and more
                driven around lunchtime. That time isn't doable for everyone.
                Find what works for you. But the most important thing is that
                you do strength train, period.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main question you should be asking yourself is, "Did I get
                the sets in for my muscles this week?" That means at least 6
                sets for that muscle group (e.g. chest) to satisfy consistency
                for this week.

              Warm-up jog: 1-5 minutes. Having an elaborate 15 to 20-minute warm-up
              is penny smart, dollar stupid. You're here to strength train.
              Make it so. <br />

                Now I don't like doing all 6 working sets at a time for a single
                muscle. I prefer smaller victories and splitting the workout in 
                half to create two cycles. For example:
                <ul>
                  <li>Bicep Curl: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets</li>
                  <li>Incline Chest Press: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets</li>
                  <li>Shoulder Side Lateral Raise: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets</li>
                </ul>                
                Then do this entire cycle all over again minus
                the warm-up sets.<br />
                I love the small victories of finishing each muscle exercise
                this split provides. And by splitting the workout this way, I
                get that feeling twice as much for every workout.

                Then do this entire cycle all over again minus
                the warm-up sets.<br />
                I love the small victories of finishing each muscle exercise
                this split provides. And by splitting the workout this way, I
                get that feeling twice as much for every workout.

                Talk to your doctor before starting any new supplementation to
                ensure you avoid taking something you shouldn't be taking.<br />
                Also, some supplements don't actually contain the vitamins and
                minerals that are plastered on the bottle. So make sure too look
                for supplements that are 3rd party tested, such as NSF
                certified, to ensure you are consuming exactly what the bottle
                says you are consuming.

              <p>
                Probably the deadliest nutrients if consumed in excess are
                sugars and refined carbohydrates because they are mostly
                stripped of their fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Sugars and
                refined carbs are incredibly addictive and increase hunger
                instead of satisfying it. This catastrophic combination makes it
                far easier for us to overconsume calories we don't need,
                especially unhealthy calories that drive disease and cancer.
                Overconsuming calories and nutrients like sugars and refined
                carbs are essentially the leading killers of humans on Earth,
                and by a lot.

                  Decreases energy and mood by increasing anxiety, depression,

                <li>
                  One of the first questions a clinical psychologist will ask a
                  new patient who comes in for anxiety and depression is: What
                  are you eating for breakfast? If the answer is nothing or very
                  little, that reveals a big problem because if you don't break
                  your fast (aka breakfast) in the morning, your body will
                  activate your fight or flight response. This response will
                  feel like anxiety and depression, but it's actually hunger.
                  This fight or flight response will also cause your body to
                  divert blood flow away from the problem-solving centers of
                  your brain, aka the prefrontal cortex, which literally makes
                  you dumber.

              <ul>
                <li>Muscle cramps, fatigue, and worse physical performance.</li>
                <li>
                  Increased heart attack risk from elevated blood pressure and
                  thicker blood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worse mood, mental clarity, and problem solving skills, i.e.,
                  you're literally dumber.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tooth decay, kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and
                  digestion issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overeating and weight gain. Thirst can often feel like hunger.

              <span>Main Causes of Dehydration:</span>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Not drinking enough water.</li>
                <li>
                  Excessive fluid loss from diuretics (caffeine, alcohol,
                  others), sweating, fever, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Not consuming enough electrolytes (potassium, sodium,
                  magnesium). However, be careful with sodium. The
                  average American is already consuming way too much sodium, 
                  which raises blood pressure, damages organs, and can lead to a stroke. 
                </li>
                <li>Vomiting or diarrhea.</li>
                <li>
                  Underlying health problems (diabetes, kidney diseases, burns,
                  etc.).

                Cancer cells rely heavily on blood sugar (glucose) for energy
                and growth. Carbohydrates — especially sugars — convert quickly
                into glucose, which can rapidly accelerate cancer growth and
                spread.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to 40% of cancers can be prevented by stopping smoking,
                reducing alcohol intake, lowering weight, exercising, getting
                good sleep, and eating healthier foods. That's at least 4
                million lives that could be saved, every single year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The more you exercise, the lower your risk of cancer.<br />
                However, the more you exercise, the more energy you deplete for
                family, friends, and work. Find what works for you.

                The closer you get to 10% body fat for men or 20% body fat or

              <p>
                Microplastics, pollution, pesticides, hygiene, antibiotics,
                water contaminants, and others.
              </p>
              <strong class="title-discussion"> Plastics </strong>
              <p>
                Unfiltered tap water and heating plastics that contain your
                drinks or food are the two biggest consumption sources of toxic
                chemicals (BPA, PFAS, etc.) and microplastics. <br />
                Heating plastics drastically speeds up its breakdown into
                microplastics, which then leak into your food and drinks.
              </p>
              <p>
                So try using a water filter, especially a reverse osmosis filter
                if you can afford it or even a pitcher water filter to help
                remove these toxic chemicals and microplastics. Pitcher water
                filters are fantastic and only cost around $50 for a great
                model.
                <br />
                Also, try avoiding plastic utensils or containers to make,
                handle, or store your food and drinks. Try using materials like
                glass, ceramic, metal, wood, or silicone. <br />
                This may be challenging to do, but even a small reduction in
                toxic chemical and microplastic exposure may provide serious
                health benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two most effective ways to remove microplastics and toxins
                from your body is to sweat and consume soluble and insoluble
                fiber. You can sweat through exercise, sauna, or whichever
                method you prefer. Great sources of fiber include beans,
                vegetables, or supplements.

                    60% of AA members smoke or vape. 
                    However, smoking cigarettes is deadly and drives up your risk of getting cancer, heart disease, and stroke.
                    Smoking also contributes to
                    the leading preventable form of cancer, lung cancer. Cigarettes 
                    contain nicotine, and this stimulant helps replace
                    the alcoholic's desire to drink alcohol, which is far more deadly and disastrous
                    to the alcoholic. So to help mitigate most of the deadly downsides of smoking
                    cigarettes, many alcoholics are now turning to nicotine pouches — which are still dangerous — but
                    much less so compared to smoking.

              <p>The consequences of unhealthy teeth, gums, and tongue are:</p>

                <li>
                  Gum disease, tooth loss, and oral infections that can spread
                  to your brain, which can be deadly.

                <li>
                  Higher likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease,

                  Bad breath and worse relationships because people tend to
                  perceive you as irresponsible and careless.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Consider a dental checkup every 6 months, but if that's too
                costly, try to go at least once a year, or every other year at
                worst.

              <strong class="title-discussion"> Brushing </strong>
              <p>
                Try to brush your teeth and tongue twice a day for at least 2
                minutes each time, such as before bed and in the morning. That
                can seem daunting, but remember, you only need to use toothpaste
                for one of those times. You can just use water — the universal
                solvent — paired with brushing (friction) for the other time.
              </p>
              <p>
                But even that can be challenging. So try to brush your teeth and tongue at
                least once a day with water, which can still produce fantastic
                results.

                better than one. So I humbly reach out to you with a call for
                aid. Would you mind providing the final principles so we can
                build this together? Maybe we can go faster alone, but we can go
                much further together. Divided we will fall. But United we can
                stand.
