                We're all unique. One size does not fit all. Find what works for

                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />
                Ask for help. You don't have to do this alone.
                <br />
                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or nurse
                practitioner, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. <br />
                Find the Truth through your own research, exploration, and
                experimentation. Also, try copying and pasting any statements on
                this site into an AI chatbot and ask, "Is this true?" You'll be
                well on your way to finding the truth.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble and fail,
                don't beat yourself up. Nobody's perfect. Get back up and keep
                moving forward.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You
                got this. Make it happen.

              <p>
                First, my mom told me over and over again: "I don't care what
                you do honey, I love you. But whatever you do, do it well." So
                that's what I focused on. And I focused on that primarily on the
                daily timeframe. "How can I crush it today?" Results followed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, I moved around a lot as a kid. We moved at least 8 times
                across 3 states by the time I was 16. I was usually the new kid
                everywhere we went. So to fit in as quickly as possible--or at
                least avoid being a total outcast loser--I learned what worked
                best: Be funny. Be of service.

                The most interesting people are the most interested in other
                people. Worry less about trying to be cool, and focus more on
                asking people cool questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you find yourself in an argument that feels like it's
                barreling toward disaster, consider saying: "You're right, makes
                sense." Now you may think you're not telling the truth, but
                that's not quite right. There's a 99% chance you missed
                something, even if it is only a small, minuscule detail. You
                still missed something.
              </p>
              <p>
                So show some compassion and humility by admitting it, and you
                will have unlocked a world of opportunity that just my save you
                from ruining a relationship. In fact, you may even strengthen
                it.

              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Car Crashes</strong>: Sleep deprivation impairs
                  reaction times and decision-making, contributing to thousands
                  of car accidents annually. Studies estimate that drowsy
                  driving causes up to 20% of fatal crashes in some regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Workplace Accidents</strong>: Fatigue from lack of
                  sleep increases errors and injuries in high-risk jobs like
                  construction, healthcare, and manufacturing, costing billions
                  in damages and lost productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Healthcare Burden</strong>: Chronic sleep deprivation
                  drives up rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease,
                  straining public health systems and increasing medical costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Tension</strong>: Irritability and poor
                  emotional regulation from sleep loss can strain relationships,
                  increase conflict, and reduce community cohesion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <span>Effects on the Immune System</span>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduced Immune Response</strong>: Sleep is critical
                  for producing cytokines, proteins that fight infection and
                  inflammation. Less sleep means fewer cytokines, weakening your
                  defense against viruses and bacteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Slower Wound Healing</strong>: Lack of sleep impairs
                  the body’s ability to repair itself, delaying recovery from
                  injuries or infections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increased Inflammation</strong>: Chronic sleep loss
                  triggers higher levels of inflammatory markers (e.g.,
                  C-reactive protein), which can contribute to diseases like
                  arthritis or diabetes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Higher Infection Risk</strong>: With a weakened immune
                  system, you’re more susceptible to colds, flu, and other
                  illnesses.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <span>Effects on Hormones</span>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testosterone</strong>: In men, sleep loss lowers
                  testosterone levels, affecting muscle mass, libido, and
                  energy. A single night of bad sleep can drop it by 10-15%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cortisol (Stress Hormone)</strong>: Sleep deprivation
                  spikes cortisol levels, keeping you in a stressed,
                  fight-or-flight state. This can lead to anxiety and burnout.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Growth Hormone</strong>: Released during deep sleep,
                  this hormone aids growth in kids and repair in adults. Lack of
                  sleep cuts its production, slowing recovery and aging the body
                  faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Insulin</strong>: Poor sleep reduces insulin
                  sensitivity, raising blood sugar levels and increasing the
                  risk of type 2 diabetes.
                </li>

                  Consistency is king. Try going to bed at the same time each

                  Your body will start to naturally combat insomnia by starting

                <li>
                  Try to avoid blue light during this time as well because it

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alcohol reduces REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the
                  restorative phase critical for memory and mood regulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alcohol relaxes throat muscles, worsening snoring or
                  obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause repeated awakenings
                  and oxygen deprivation during the night.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, a chemical that promotes
                  sleepiness, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially
                  delaying sleep by 30-60 minutes or more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even if you fall asleep, caffeine decreases deep sleep
                  (slow-wave sleep), leaving you feeling less rested and more
                  fatigued the next day.
                </li>

                  Try to stop drinking alcohol at least two hours before going

                  Try to avoid jacking up your energy state starting at least
                  one hour before going to bed. Otherwise, going to sleep will

                </li>
                <li>
                  Try to create a cooler environment around you before going to
                  bed. Try to maintain this cooler environment while sleeping to
                  maximize sleep quality. Air conditioning can be very helpful
                  here but also extremely expensive. A great alternative is to
                  use a fan. Fans can be just as effective as AC while also

                </li>
                <li>
                  If you can't fall asleep within 15-30 minutes of going to bed,
                  are you overthinking or ruminating?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If so, try to stop and think about your happy place, or
                  nothing at all. The latter is surprisingly effective, but
                  challenging to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If those don't work, have a notepad nearby that you can use to
                  write down your worries and frustrations. Try to capture in
                  words what's really bothering you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overthinking and ruminating are your brain's ways of trying to
                  help you. Your brain wants you to see and fully understand
                  some specific problems, and then solve them to avoid future
                  pain. Show it some respect. Write it all down. Writing proves
                  to your brain that you actually see the problems and threats,
                  which is half the battle. Once you prove this to your brain
                  through writing, it will then allow you to relax and fall
                  asleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But before trying to fall asleep again, schedule a time
                  tomorrow to further tackle your thoughts and worries. The goal
                  is to fully prove to your brain that you see these threats and
                  are committed to tackling them. Tell your brain you need sleep
                  to do so, or these future problems could get much worse.

                The adage, "You can't outrun a bad diet," is mostly true.
                However, being sedentary is catastrophic to our health because
                it significantly increases the risk of death from cardiovascular
                disease and cancer. Furthermore, this adage fails to account for
                the benefits exercise has on sticking to a healthier diet.
                Embarking on a healthy diet without exercise can be quite
                challenging. But exercise can make it much easier by improving
                mental health, elevating nutrient absorption, and dampening food
                cravings, especially for unhealthy food.

              <p>
                Add strength training to your routine to build muscle strength,
                improve bone health, boost metabolism, and manage weight. And
                look more attractive!
              </p>
              <p>
                Your #1 job is to tell your body that this muscle needs to grow.
                <br />
                You do that by putting stress on your muscles, joints, organs,
                and body. As David Goggins put it, "To grow, you must suffer."
                <br />
                One interesting side effect of exercise stress is that some
                cancer cells are too vulnerable to handle it. They die--not all
                of them--but many do because of their vulnerable state. Your
                body rebuilds and replenishes your healthy cells as a response
                to exercise stress, but some cancer cells will die under these
                stressful conditions.
              </p>

                The main question you should be asking yourself is, "Did I get
                the sets in for my muscles this week?"

              <p>
                Probably the deadliest nutrients if consumed in excess are
                sugars and refined carbohydrates because they are mostly
                stripped of their fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Sugars and
                refined carbs are incredibly addictive and increase hunger
                instead of satisfying it. This catastrophic combination makes it
                far easier for us to overconsume calories we don't need,
                especially unhealthy calories that drive disease and cancer.
                Overconsuming calories and nutrients like sugars and refined
                carbs are essentially the leading killers of humans on Earth,
                and by a lot.

                  The chief benefit of fasting is likely not fasting itself, but
                  simply reducing overall caloric intake.

                  Decreases energy and mood by increasing anxiety, depression,

                  One of the first questions a clinical psychologist will ask a
                  new patient who comes in for anxiety and depression is: What
                  are you eating for breakfast? If the answer is nothing or very
                  little, that reveals a big problem because if you don't break
                  your fast (aka breakfast) in the morning, your body will
                  activate your fight or flight response. This response will
                  feel like anxiety and depression, but it's actually hunger.
                  This fight or flight response will also cause your body to
                  divert blood flow away from the problem-solving centers of
                  your brain, aka the prefrontal cortex, which literally makes
                  you dumber.

                Cancer cells rely heavily on blood sugar (glucose) for energy
                and growth. Carbohydrates--especially sugars--convert quickly

                  Gum disease, tooth loss, and oral infections that can spread

                  Higher likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease,

              </ol>
              <p>
                Consider a dental checkup every 6 months, but if that's too

                Try to brush your teeth and tongue twice a day for at least 2
                minutes each time, such as before bed and in the morning. That
                can seem daunting, but remember, you only need to use toothpaste
                for one of those times. You can just use water--the universal
                solvent--paired with brushing (friction) for the other time.
              </p>

                But even that can be challenging. So try to brush your teeth at
                least once a day with water, which can still produce fantastic

                much further together. Divided we fall. United we stand.
