            A life lived without adventure, deep relationships, good health, and
            excellence, is not a life. It's a prison sentence. <br />
            So embark on your adventure, nurture relationships along the way,
            take care of the body and mind you've been given, and whatever you
            do, as long as it's for good, do it well, and with all your heart.

                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />
                Ask for help. You don't have to do this alone.
                <br />
                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or nurse
                practitioner, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. <br />
                Find the Truth through your own research, exploration, and
                experimentation. Asking questions and listening can become some
                of your most powerful problem solving tools. So try copying and
                pasting any statements on this site into an AI chatbot and ask,
                "Is this true?" You'll be well on your way to finding the truth.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble and fail,
                don't beat yourself up. Nobody's perfect. Get back up and keep
                moving forward.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You

              >
              <p>
                First, my mom told me over and over again: "I don't care what
                you do honey, I love you. But whatever you do, do it well." So
                that's what I focused on. And I focused on that primarily on the
                daily timeframe. Today is the championship. How can I crush it
                today? Results followed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, I moved around a lot as a kid. We moved at least 8 times
                across 3 states by the time I was 16. I was usually the new kid
                everywhere we went. So to fit in as quickly as possible — or at
                least avoid being a total outcast loser — I learned what worked
                best: Be a good person. Be funny. Be helpful.

                Some of the most interesting people are the most interested in other
                people. Worry less about trying to be cool, and focus more on
                asking people cool questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you find yourself in an argument that feels like it's
                barreling toward disaster, consider saying: "You're right, makes
                sense." Now you may think you're not telling the truth, but
                that's not quite right. There's a 99% chance you missed
                something, even if it is only a small, minuscule detail. You
                still missed something.
              </p>
              <p>
                So show some compassion and humility by admitting it, and you
                will have unlocked a world of opportunity that just my save you
                from ruining a relationship. In fact, you may even strengthen
                it.

              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Car Crashes</strong>: Sleep deprivation impairs
                  reaction times and decision-making, contributing to thousands
                  of car accidents annually. Studies estimate that drowsy
                  driving causes up to 20% of fatal crashes in some regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Workplace Accidents</strong>: Fatigue from lack of
                  sleep increases errors and injuries in high-risk jobs like
                  construction, healthcare, and manufacturing, costing billions
                  in damages and lost productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Healthcare Burden</strong>: Chronic sleep deprivation
                  drives up rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease,
                  straining public health systems and increasing medical costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Tension</strong>: Irritability and poor
                  emotional regulation from sleep loss can strain relationships,
                  increase conflict, and reduce community cohesion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <span>Effects on the Immune System</span>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduced Immune Response</strong>: Sleep is critical
                  for producing cytokines, proteins that fight infection and
                  inflammation. Less sleep means fewer cytokines, weakening your
                  defense against viruses and bacteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Slower Wound Healing</strong>: Lack of sleep impairs
                  the body's ability to repair itself, delaying recovery from
                  injuries or infections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increased Inflammation</strong>: Chronic sleep loss
                  triggers higher levels of inflammatory markers (e.g.,
                  C-reactive protein), which can contribute to diseases like
                  arthritis or diabetes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Higher Infection Risk</strong>: With a weakened immune
                  system, you're more susceptible to colds, flu, and other
                  illnesses.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testosterone</strong>: In men, sleep loss lowers
                  testosterone levels, affecting muscle mass, libido, and
                  energy. A single night of bad sleep can drop it by 10-15%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cortisol (Stress Hormone)</strong>: Sleep deprivation
                  spikes cortisol levels, keeping you in a stressed,
                  fight-or-flight state. This can lead to anxiety and burnout.
                </li>

                  Alcohol reduces REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the

                </li>
                <li>
                  Alcohol relaxes throat muscles, worsening snoring or

                <li>
                  Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, a chemical that promotes
                  sleepiness, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially
                  delaying sleep by 30-60 minutes or more.

                <li>
                  Even if you fall asleep, caffeine decreases deep sleep

                  Try to avoid jacking up your energy state starting at least

                  Try to avoid overly warm conditions if possible because they

                  Try to create a cooler environment around you before going to

                  maximize sleep quality. Air conditioning can be very helpful
                  here but also extremely expensive. A great alternative is to
                  use a fan. Fans can be just as effective as AC while also

                  AC or even fans may not be working for you. Try drinking a

                  Overthinking and ruminating are probably the biggest drivers

                  If you can't fall asleep within 15-30 minutes of going to bed,

                </li>
                <li>
                  If so, try to stop and think about your happy place, or
                  nothing at all. The latter is surprisingly effective, but
                  challenging to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If those don't work, have a notepad nearby that you can use to
                  write down your worries and frustrations. Try to capture in
                  words what's really bothering you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overthinking and ruminating are your brain's ways of trying to
                  help you. Your brain wants you to see and fully understand
                  some specific problems, and then solve them to avoid future
                  pain. Show it some respect. Write it all down. Writing proves
                  to your brain that you actually see the problems and threats,
                  which is half the battle. Once you prove this to your brain
                  through writing, it will then allow you to relax and fall
                  asleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But before trying to fall asleep again, schedule a time
                  tomorrow to further tackle your thoughts and worries. The goal
                  is to fully prove to your brain that you see these threats and
                  are committed to tackling them. Tell your brain you need sleep
                  to do so, or these future problems could get much worse.

              <p>
                The adage, "You can't outrun a bad diet," is mostly true.
                However, being sedentary is catastrophic to our health because
                it significantly increases the risk of death from cardiovascular
                disease and cancer. Furthermore, this adage fails to account for
                the benefits exercise has on sticking to a healthier diet.
                Embarking on a healthy diet without exercise can be quite
                challenging. But exercise can make it much easier by improving
                mental health, elevating nutrient absorption, and dampening food
                cravings, especially for unhealthy food.

                Exercise is Spring Cleaning for Your Body and Mind. <br />
              </strong>
              <p>
                Every time you exercise, your body goes into action removing
                old, damaged cells to make way for new, healthy ones.
                And intense exercise increases body temperature, metabolic stress,
                and oxidative stress. These stressors trigger the release of
                heat shock proteins, which help protect cells by refolding
                damaged proteins, preventing protein clumping, and aiding
                cellular repair.<br /><br />
                Therefore, Exercise is a whole body and mind rejuvenation.
                <br /><br />
                Without exercise, your body becomes clogged and cluttered with
                unhealthy cells, which significantly increases the risk of
                disease and cancer. <br /><br />

              <p>
                Try to avoid getting injured or you won't be able to maintain
                crucial consistency. Showing up for even a little bit of
                exercise is infinitely better than not.
              </p>
              <p>The leading causes of injury tend to be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Explosive actions. Moving too fast.</li>
                <li>
                  Lifting much heavier weight than your body is used to, or
                  doing many more sets/reps than your body is used to.
                </li>
                <li>Poor technique and form.</li>
                <li>
                  Not warming up the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints
                  before intense effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pushing through pain that feels like a sudden, sharp sting. A
                  burning sensation is generally what you're looking for. Sudden
                  sharp pain is not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your target muscles or joints for the day are still really sore,
                  and you can't lift around the same weight, reps, and sets you did
                  last time, you probably need more
                  time off from the gym — or at least lighter weight per rep —
                  to help give them time to heal and grow stronger.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong class="title-discussion">Strength Training</strong>
              <p>
                Add strength training to your routine to build muscle strength,
                improve bone health, boost metabolism, and manage weight. And
                look more attractive!<br />
                Muscles are huge blood sugar (glucose) sinks, which increases
                insulin sensitivity and lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes and
                dementia. In fact, skeletal muscle is the largest site of
                glucose disposal in the entire body. <br />
                Aim for at least one 30-minute workout per week, and 6 sets per
                muscle group (e.g. chest).
              </p>
              <p>
                Muscles and bones are challenged at the gym through iron and
                sweat. <br />
                Muscles and bones are built at home through food and sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your #1 job is to tell your body that this muscle needs to grow.
                <br />
                You do that by putting stress on your muscles, joints, organs,
                and body. As David Goggins put it, "To grow, you must suffer."
                <br />
                One interesting side effect of exercise stress is that some
                cancer cells are too vulnerable to handle it. They die — not all
                of them — but many do because of their vulnerable state. Your
                body rebuilds and replenishes your healthy cells as a response
                to exercise stress, but some cancer cells will die under these
                stressful conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time of day you strength train matters. For me, I'm at least
                20-33% weaker in the early mornings. I'm much stronger and more
                driven around lunchtime. That time isn't doable for everyone.
                Find what works for you. But the most important thing is that
                you do strength train, period.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main question you should be asking yourself is, "Did I get
                the sets in for my muscles this week?" That means at least 6
                sets for that muscle group (e.g. chest) to satisfy consistency
                for this week.

                Get hand sanitizer for after your workout. Over 70% of gym

              Warm-up jog: 1-5 minutes. Having an elaborate 15 to 20-minute
              warm-up is penny smart, dollar stupid. You're here to strength
              train. Make it so. <br />

                half to create two cycles. For example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bicep Curl: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets</li>
                <li>Incline Chest Press: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets</li>
                <li>
                  Shoulder Side Lateral Raise: 1 warm-up set, 3 working sets
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Then do this entire cycle all over again minus the warm-up
                sets.<br />
                I love the small victories of finishing each muscle exercise
                this split provides. And by splitting the workout this way, I
                get that feeling twice as much for every workout.

                for supplements that are 3rd party tested, such as NSF
                certified, to ensure you are consuming exactly what the bottle
                says you are consuming.

                      and intensity during a workout. Training fasted will
                      likely make you weaker and less motivated during a

                      right after a workout may reduce muscle and tissue repair. So
                      consider taking Vitamin C at least 4 hours after
                      a workout, and preferably right before bedtime because sleep is when most
                      of muscle and tissue repair take place.

              <p>
                Probably the deadliest nutrients if consumed in excess are
                sugars and refined carbohydrates because they are mostly
                stripped of their fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They also cause
                immediate and huge spikes in blood sugar (glucose), which can lead to 
                insulin resistance and eventually diabetes. <br>
                Sugars and refined carbs are also incredibly addictive and increase hunger
                instead of satisfying it. This catastrophic combination makes it
                far easier for us to overconsume calories we don't need,
                especially unhealthy calories that drive disease and cancer.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Overconsuming calories — especially from sugars and refined carbohydrates — is
                one of the leading killers of humans on Earth because
                it's a major driver of cardiovascular disease (the #1 global killer),
                type 2 diabetes, obesity-related cancers, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
                Dr. Frank Hu of Harvard revealed that people who consume 
                17–21% of their calories from added sugar had a 38% higher 
                risk of dying from heart disease compared to those consuming less than 10%.

              </p>            
              <p>
                Therefore, in general, we can dramatically improve our health
                by eating fewer calories, refined carbs, sugar, and saturated fats, and eating
                more protein, whole carbs, fiber, and unsaturated fats (discussed in detail below).

                Editor's Note: I'm an alcoholic who has used nicotine pouches
                and has struggled with a passion for food and overeating. Even knowing these things
                are bad for me, I still did them to excess. I'm a chief
                hypocrite. To be healthy is not easy. It's tough for us all.

                  A common question that clinical psychologists will ask a

                  are you eating for breakfast?" If you don't eat in the morning
                  and break your fast (aka breakfast), your body may

                  Not consuming enough electrolytes (potassium, sodium,

                Cancer cells rely heavily on blood sugar (glucose) for energy
                and growth. Carbohydrates — especially sugars — convert quickly
                into glucose, which can rapidly accelerate cancer growth and

                Up to 40% of cancers can be prevented by stopping smoking,
                reducing alcohol intake, lowering weight, exercising, getting
                good sleep, and eating healthier foods. That's at least 4

              <strong class="title-discussion"> Toxins </strong>
              <p>
                Microplastics, pollution, pesticides, hygiene, antibiotics,
                water contaminants, and others.
              </p>
              <strong class="title-discussion"> Plastics </strong>
              <p>
                Unfiltered tap water and heating plastics that contain your
                drinks or food are the two biggest consumption sources of toxic
                chemicals (BPA, PFAS, etc.) and microplastics. <br />
                Heating plastics drastically speeds up its breakdown into
                microplastics, which then leak into your food and drinks.
              </p>
              <p>
                So try using a water filter, especially a reverse osmosis filter
                if you can afford it or even a pitcher water filter to help
                remove these toxic chemicals and microplastics. Pitcher water
                filters are fantastic and only cost around $50 for a great
                model.
                <br />
                Also, try to avoid plastic utensils or containers to make,
                handle, or store your food and drinks. Try using materials like
                glass, ceramic, metal, wood, or silicone. <br />
                This may be challenging to do, but even a small reduction in
                toxic chemical and microplastic exposure may provide serious
                health benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                But what if we've already consumed toxins and microplastics? Are
                we out of luck? Absolutely not. The two most effective ways to
                remove microplastics and toxins from your body is to sweat from
                heating up your body, as well as to consume soluble and
                insoluble fiber. You can sweat through exercise, sauna, or
                whichever method you prefer. Great sources of fiber include
                beans, fruit, vegetables, and supplements.

                  – About 60% of AA members smoke or vape. However, smoking
                  cigarettes is deadly and drives up your risk of getting
                  cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Smoking also contributes to
                  the leading preventable form of cancer, lung cancer.
                  Cigarettes contain nicotine, and this stimulant helps replace
                  the alcoholic's desire to drink alcohol, which is far more
                  deadly and disastrous to the alcoholic. So to help mitigate
                  most of the deadly downsides of smoking cigarettes, many
                  alcoholics are now turning to 3mg nicotine pouches — which are
                  still dangerous — but much less so compared to smoking or drinking.

              <strong class="title-discussion"> Brushing Your Teeth </strong>
             <p>
               The main goal for brushing and flossing your teeth is to remove
               plaque (dangerous bacteria) and decaying food from your mouth. Why? 
               Because this decaying
               food supercharges the growth of dangerous plaque bacteria that drive
               disease and cancer.
             </p>
              <p>
                So try to brush your teeth and tongue twice a day for at least 2
                minutes each time, such as before bed and in the morning. That
                can seem daunting, but remember, you only need to use toothpaste
                for one of those times. You can just use water — the universal
                solvent — paired with brushing (friction) for the other time.
              </p>
              <p>
                But even that can be challenging. So try to brush your teeth and
                tongue at least once a day with water, which can still produce
                fantastic results.
              </p>
              <strong class="title-discussion"> Flossing </strong>
              <p>
                While brushing your teeth will remove the majority of plaque bacteria and decaying 
                food from your mouth, there will still be some stuck
                between your teeth. This insidious amount of plaque bacteria and 
                decaying food can still drive disease
                and cancer, and lead to gum disease, tooth loss, and an increased
                risk of heart disease due to chronic oral inflammation. So try
                to floss at least once a week or more, and when food gets stuck in your
                teeth.

                The most important thing to keep in mind 
                is change. If you have a spot on your body that looks weird but has looked 
                weird and roughly the same size and color for years, it's probably not cancer. However, if
                you see a newer spot on your body that's changing size or color, or even an older spot that you've had for 
                years but is starting to change size or color, then that needs to fire your alarm bells. Let your doctor 
                know immediately so he or she can perform crucial tests that can save your life.
