                Lifelong learning. Science and research are constantly revealing
                new insights and disproving old ones.
                <br />

                I am an accomplished intel analyst, not a doctor, or nurse
                practitioner, or physiologist, or nutritionist. So view these
                principles with extreme prejudice and skepticism. Find the Truth
                through research, testing, and experimentation, and not by
                blindly trusting what someone says on the internet.
                <br />
                It's a Journey, one day at a time. If you stumble and fail, don't beat
                yourself up. Nobody's perfect. Get back up and keep moving forward.
                <br />
                Victory over time is the goal, not one day, or one battle. You
                got this. Make it happen.

              <ul>

                  Consistency is king. Try going to bed at the same time each

                  powerful calming effect.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Overthinking and ruminating are probably the biggest drivers

                </li>
                <li>
                  If you can't fall asleep within 15-30 minutes, are you
                  overthinking or ruminating?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If so, try to stop and think about your happy place, or
                  nothing at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If that doesn't work, have a notepad nearby that you can use
                  to write down your worries and frustrations. Try to capture in
                  words what's really bothering you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overthinking and ruminating are your brain's way of trying to
                  help you. It wants you to process fears to avoid future pain.
                  Show it some respect. Write it all down. Writing proves to
                  your brain that you actually see the problems and threats,
                  which is half the battle. Once you prove this to your brian
                  through writing, it will then allow you to relax and fall
                  asleep.

              <p>
                The adage, "You can't outrun a bad diet," is 100% true. However,
                being sedentary is catastrophic to our health because it
                significantly increases the risk of death from cardiovascular
                disease and cancer. Furthermore, this adage fails to account for
                the benefits exercise has on sticking to a healthier diet.
                Embarking on a healthy diet without exercise is incredibly
                challenging. But exercise can make it much easier by improving
                mental health, elevating nutrient absorption, and dampening food
                cravings -- especially for unhealthy food.

              <p>
                Your #1 job is to tell your body that this muscle needs to grow.
                <br />
                You do that by putting stress on your muscles, joints, organs,
                and body. As David Goggins put it, "To grow, you must suffer."
                <br />
                One interesting side effect of exercise stress is that some
                cancer cells are too vulnerable to handle it. They die -- not all
                of them -- but many do because of their vulnerable state. Your
                body rebuilds and replenishes your healthy cells as a response
                to exercise stress, but some cancer cells will die under these
                stressful conditions.

              Slow and controlled. Pause at the eccentric stretch
                of the muscle. Every rep counts. Don't rush it.

                Hazardous Nutrients and Substances if Consumed in Excess
              </strong>
              <p>
                Calories in General, Carbohydrates (especially sugars and refined carbohydrates), Trans and Saturated Fats, Sodium, Fried Foods,
                Sauces, Dressings, Caffeine, Nicotine, and Alcohol.
              </p>
              <p>
                Probably the deadliest nutrients if consumed in excess are sugars and refined
                carbohydrates because they are 
                mostly stripped of their fiber and any nutrients, which make them incredibly
                addictive, and increase hunger instead of satisfying it. This catastrophic 
                combination makes it far easier for us to overconsume calories
                we don't need, especially unhealthy calories that drive disease
                and cancer. Overconsuming calories and toxic nutrients like
                sugars are essentially the leading killers of humans on Earth,
                and by a lot.

              <strong>Fasting Plus Big Meals - Pros and Cons:</strong>
              <ul>

                <li>
                  The chief benefit of fasting is likely not fasting itself, but
                  simply reducing overall caloric intake.
                </li>
                <li>Damages sleep quality and reduces muscle mass.</li>
                <li>
                  Decreases energy and increases anxiety, depression, lethargy,
                  and irritability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One of the first questions a clinical psychologist will ask a
                  new patient who comes in for depression and anxiety is: What
                  are you eating for breakfast? If the answer is nothing or very
                  little, that reveals a big problem because if you don't break
                  your fast (aka breakfast) in the morning, your body will
                  activate your fight or flight response. This response will
                  feel like anxiety and depression, but it's actually hunger.
                  This fight or flight response will also cause your body to literally divert blood flow away from
                  the problem-solving centers of your brain, aka the prefrontal cortex, which makes you dumber. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creates huge spikes in blood sugar (glucose) when you eat,
                  which results in crashes in energy and mental clarity.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong>More Regular Small Meals - Pros and Cons:</strong>

                <li>
                  Provides sustained energy and mental acuity throughout the
                  day, and without big crashes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dampens hunger signals because you know you'll be eating again
                  in ~3 hours anyway.

                  Small meals can become big meals if you're not careful and

                It's best to brush your teeth and tongue twice a day for at

                You only need to use toothpaste for one of those
                times. You can just use water (the universal solvent) and
                brushing for the other time. But even that can be challenging. So

                which can still produce fantastic results. <br /><br>
                It's best to floss once or

                Consider a dental checkup every 6 months, but if that's
                too costly, try to go at least once a year, or every other year
